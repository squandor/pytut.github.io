The most basic building-block of any programming language is the concept of a variable, a name and place in memory that we reserve for a value. 
In Python, we use this syntax to create a variable and assign a value to this variable:
<var_name> = <value>
For example:
age = 56
name = "Nora"
color = "Blue"
grades = [67, 100, 87, 56]
If the name of a variable has more than one word, then the Style Guide for Python Code recommends separating words with an underscore "as necessary to improve readability."
For example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
